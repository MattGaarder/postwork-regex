# Collaborative Code Review Platform

### Project Overview

Create a web-based platform that allows university students to collaborate on coding projects and conduct code reviews. The platform should facilitate real-time feedback from peers and include gamification elements to encourage participation and constructive feedback. The solution must support multiple programming languages to accommodate diverse student projects and must not contain any third-party advertisements.

### Deliverables

- Web Application: A web application that implements the core functionality of the collaborative code review platform, including:
- User authentication and user profiles (registration, login, logout)
- Ability for users to create projects and invite others to collaborate
- Code submission feature across multiple programming languages
- Commenting system where users can leave feedback on specific lines of code
- Gamification elements such as points, badges, or leaderboards for active reviewers
- Documentation: A README file that includes:
- Installation and setup instructions
- Brief explanation of how to use the platform
- Overview of the gamification elements implemented
- Testing: Unit tests demonstrating the functionality of core components.
- Source Code: A link to a public GitHub repository or zip file containing the complete source code.

### Acceptance Criteria

- The web application must successfully handle user registration and login processes.
- Users should be able to create, manage, and delete their projects.
- Users must be able to submit code snippets in at least three different programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java).
- The commenting system must allow users to provide feedback on specific lines of code within any submission.
- Gamification features should be functional, allowing users to earn points and see their ranking on a leaderboard after contributing feedback.
- The platform should be responsive and usable on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Proper documentation (README) must be included without errors and clearly explain setup and functionality.
